analysis of inoculation tests for determining competencies of hosts for P. ramorum

The most common tree species in the Big Sur area were used to test the competency of P. ramorum, the causative agent of Sudden Oak Death. We inoculated leaves from 32 individuals for each species with inoculum for the treatment and water for the controls. We quantified spore production of sporangia, the spores important for transmission, and chlamydospores, the spores potentially important for survival in the soil.
