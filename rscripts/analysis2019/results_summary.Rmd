# Main points
- report on infection and sporangia viability
- report on controls
- differences in sporangia production
- differences in chlamydospore production
- relationships between sporangia, chlamydos and lesion sizes  

## viability tests  
If present, up to two replicates of symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves in both the control and treatment groups were used to test the presence of viable *Phytophthora* infections and sporangia. We detected no viable infections or sporangia in the controls. Most controls did not have any symptomatic samples, but those that did had lesions caused by non-oomycetes.  

In contrast, for all of the species there were at least two symptomatic samples in the treatment group (*see table*). We detected viable infections from all species except for HEAR. Most symptomatic samples had both viable infections and sporangia, and when there were asymptomatic samples available, many were also still viable. This indicates that P. ramorum is capable of producing latent, transmissible infections.

```{r viability, echo=F, results='asis', warning=F}
vtab <- readxl::read_excel('data2019/viability.xlsx', sheet = 2, skip = 1)
names(vtab)[c(4, 5)] <- c("Infection", "Sporangia")
#+ and - not formatting. change to y and n
vtab <- apply(vtab, 2, function(x) ifelse(x=="+", "Y", x))
vtab <- apply(vtab, 2, function(x) ifelse(x=="-", "N", x))

kable(vtab) %>%

  pack_rows("leaf dip assay", 11, 15) %>% 
  #add footnote
  footnote("Results of the viability tests for the treatment group only. Species are split by assay and by lesion presence (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Viable Phytophthora infections and sporangia are denoted by the following symbols: Y = presence, N = absence, NA = no sample available.")
```


## controls
Out of 424 control replicates in the leaf disc and dip assays, no chlamydospores were found and only low quantities of sporangia were detected in 2 samples. Out of 9 5-ul subsamples, we detected 1 sporangia twice in a UMCA individual in the leaf disc assay, and 1 sporangia once in a SESE individual. We therefore consider the background levels of *P. ramorum* on our collected leaves to be negligible and all following analyses were performed on the treatment replicates.  

## Sporangia production
